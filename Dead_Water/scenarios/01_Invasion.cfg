# The key to this scenario is *Control the villages!" You get a bunch of free citizens, so send them all directions and take as many villages as possible right away. Recruit two level ones (fighters or hunters) and the rest citizens this turn. Send those two and two or three citizens straight south to get in a battle over the group of villages there. Try not to lose the level one units, but more importantly, don't let any bats by! Another level one unit may be necessary in the lower middle of the map to stop village stealers. Send one more fighter and some citizens to hold the north-east corner villages. Don't worry about the land ones too much, but hold the water ones. Recruit the initiates last. Use them to kill off any bats still being pests (they are very effective at this), then send them south-east. They should join a fighter or hunter or two, Cylanna, Gwabbo, and a few citizens to take on the skeletons (who will just be arriving) and the swimming zombies. When the first wave is through, circle everyone around to the enemy leader. Try to make some brawlers, and take Gwabbo's advice to get Krellis as much experience as possible.

# The main event here pops zombies out of villages taken by enemy units. There is also a fair bit of animation and story events. On event makes a black ghost rise from the corpse of the enemy leader and disappear under the mountain. There is also some action around a southern village.

            story= _ "In the Northern Lands, where the Mountains of Dorth reach the coast, lies a bay with a narrow mouth. In this bay was the merman city of Jotha. The natural harbor and the prosperity of the merfolk within drew many envious eyes. Still, none could match the strength of the mermen in their aquatic domain, and countless orc raiding parties were driven from the shores."
        [/part]

        [part]
            story= _ "In 626 YW, Jotha was attacked by the largest raiding party yet. The king, Kai Laudiss, and his troops repelled the raiders, but several good soldiers were killed. When the raiders finally fled, Kai Laudiss readied his army to follow, determined to secure the safety of Jotha with an overwhelming display of force. The merman army caught up as the orc band reached the port city of Tirigaz."
        [/part]

        [part]
            story= _ "Under the cover of darkness, the mermen slid into the bay ready to launch a surprise attack at dawn. But the orcs were ready for this, and had devised a surprise of their own. The ships at the mouth of the bay that had seemed empty suddenly disgorged hordes of orcs. More of them poured out of the city. The mermen were now trapped and vastly outnumbered."
        [/part]

        [part]
            story= _ "Kai Laudiss' army fought fiercely, slaying five orcs for every soldier they lost. The orcs discovered that trapped mermen were tougher than they had imagined, and found themselves fleeing into the forest to escape their spears. It was a defeat the orcs would not soon forget, but the cost was high. Kai Laudiss was killed along with most of his army. When the remaining soldiers returned to Jotha, Krellis, the son of Kai Laudiss, discovered that he was now Kai."
        [/part]

        [part]
            story= _ "Kai Krellis felt too young for the responsibilities of a kingdom, so he relied on the wisdom of a priestess named Cylanna. She had been a friend of his father, and he had known her as long as he could remember. Cylanna mourned the former Kai, but believed that his sacrifice would allow Krellis to preside over an age of peace. Unfortunately, that was not to be. A new enemy appeared from under the mountains."
