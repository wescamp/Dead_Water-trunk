# This scenario should be rated "R" for massive violence! Both sides can do lots of damage to the other. Here's where you can use all the piercing units you have. Hopefully you haven't been totally ignoring the spearman and warrior lines. Even level one units can do pretty high damage to drakes though, so you can level up some more here. Don't get any units besides piercing ones. Netcasters aren't really necessary, and one diviner is enough. Actually, don't get *any* units for about four turns. The drakes will take a while getting to you, so just take some villages and let your income work. Don't worry about *holding* the villages, you'll get a bonus in the end if you survive. Just worry about getting enough units that you do survive. Let the first wave of drakes come to you. You'll have the advantage in the water--even against high-level units. They will kill some of your weaker units, but you will do far more damage to them, and level up some new ones in the process. If you survive the first wave, you should be fine. You will have to do a little fighting on land, but you can stay mostly in villages at least. Just be careful about how many units can attack each of yours.

# This is a very simple scenario. The only interesting bit is that the drakes talk to each other in their own language. See the note about that below.

(I'm assuming they have one, because most drakes I've seen don't seem quite fluent in whatever it is everyone else speaks.) The mermen wouldn't understand it, so I'm not putting it in English. I'm making up snippets of drake language, so the literal translations I had in mind are listed here. Being a caste-based society, they will have a hundred pronouns, and a lot of meaning will be in exactly which ones they decide to use. The bz... and bh... words are the pronouns here. (It's uneccessary for the *player* to know exactly what was said because it's easy to guess the intent.)
